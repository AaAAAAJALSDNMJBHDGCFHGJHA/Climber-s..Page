<li><strong>Climbing Shoes:</strong>Use appropriate climbing shoes for better grip and control.</li>
<li><stong>Belay Device & Rope:</stong>When roped climbing, use an approved belay device and rope with the correct strength rating.</li>
<li><strong>Quickdraws & Anchors (for lead climbing):</strong>Check that all equipment is properly placed and locked before ascending.</li>

<h2>2. Communication</h2>
<li><strong>Climbing Calls:</strong>Use clear and agreed-upon commands (e.g., "On belay?", "Climbing!", "Take!", "Slack!").</li>
<li><strong>Belayer-Climber Communication:</strong>Ensure the belayer and climber communicate well and understand each other's signals.</li>

<h2>3. Follow Proper Belaying Techniques</h2>
<li><strong>Attention:</strong> The belayer should be alert at all times, keeping an eye on the climber and responding to their needs.</li>
<li><strong>Brake Hand:</strong> Always keep your brake hand on the rope, especially when feeding or taking in slack.</li>
<li><strong>Backup Systems:</strong> For lead climbing, make sure there are backup knots or appropriate belay devices to prevent accidents.</li>

<h2>4. Check Everything Twice</h2>
<li><strong>Partner Check:</strong> Before starting, check your partner's gear (harness, belay device, knots, helmet, and shoes).</li>
<li><strong>Knots & Gear:</strong> Ensure that all knots (especially the figure-eight) and carabiners are properly tied and locked.</li>

<h2>5. Climb Within Your Limits</h2>

<h2>10. Learn & Practice Self-Rescue Techniques</h2>
